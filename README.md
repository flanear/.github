## Idea
Flanear is a Move-to-Earn and Play-to-Earn game built on top of NEAR Protocol.
Our idea was adding more game mechanics into M2E. So steps won’t be just converted into steps, but be used in interactive games against other players.
So merging real life actions and competition in games we will create metaverse.

## Flanears

Flaners are people who walk along the boulevards for the purpose of entertainment and enjoyment.
Flanears are the characters of the game on the NEAR blockchain.
You need a Flanear NFT to battle other people and get FLAN token.

## Tokenomics
Flanear has a classic for M2E projects double token design

### Krok(KRK) token
We always want to bring a little of our identity to projects, so our first token is called KROK, which means step in Ukrainian.<br>
*This token is awarded for the steps you make.*

### Fla-NEAR(FLAN) token
The second token is named after the project, Fla-NEAR. And here we pay tribute to the NEAR blockchain, for all of us this is not the first project in its ecosystem.
*This token is awarded for wins in P2P battles.*<br>
